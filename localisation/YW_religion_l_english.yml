 mushi_religion_desc: "Belief in the invisible creatures known as Mushi. They inhabite the world without benevolence or malice, simply existing. Some of these existances naturally bend and shape the world around them. Though they do not intend any of the consequences their existances bring, some of the more powerful of them are thought to have created our universe, in passing, through their nature."
